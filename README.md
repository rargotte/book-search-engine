# book-search-engine
 Google Books GraphQL API search engine  built with Apollo Server.

## Description
In this project we took starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. .
